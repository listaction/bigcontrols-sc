## Usage of the contract
---

This describes how the smart contract will be used, in what order functions are expected to be invoked when
it is executed in practice.

2) addBuyer - input is the address of investors are participating in the private sale

3) setFreezingPeriod - optional call - input is the freeze period for tokens with time in seconds

4) setCompanyWallet - input is the address of the Ethereum wallet of the company to which funds will be transferred after the private sale.

5) startICO - starts the private sale (ICO)

6) Fallback function for sending ethers to smart contract

7) sendTokens - for manual transfer of token on BTC value

8) stopICO - to stop the private sale (ICO) and transfer funds to the company wallet from step 4

9) refundEther - to refund in some emergency state
